##
For this project we explored what factors that may influence the value of housing in Southern California (home values and rental prices).  We used machine learning tools to predict the price of a property based on the following features:
## City / Zip
## Number of bathrooms (half & full)
## Number of Bedrooms
## Building Size (sq ft)
## Lot Size (sq ft)

## Limitations
After running our machine learning models, we found that our accuracy was not as high as we would have liked. We came to realize that this was due to a couple of factors:
### Limited Data:
We were limited at the time to only 200 listings per region. If we had more listings, we believe it would be much more accurate.
### Time Constraint:
We would have liked to include other data sources that are key factors in determining the value of a property such as:
### Crime rate in the area
### Type of area location/ city
### Median household income
